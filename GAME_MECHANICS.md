# Rat Racer - Game Mechanics & Strategy Guide

## Overview

Rat Racer features deep strategic gameplay where understanding bloodlines, stats, race composition, and timing creates competitive advantages. This is NOT a simple random number generator - every decision matters.

---

## Core Stats

### Stamina (50-100)

- **Controls fatigue resistance** - Low stamina rats slow down significantly in later segments
- **Affects variance** - Lower stamina = more unpredictable performance
- **Time-of-day interaction** - Stamina rats perform better at night

**Strategic Use**: Essential for longer races. Pairs well with "Underground Elite" and "Alley Cat" bloodlines.

### Agility (50-100)

- **Controls variance** - Higher agility = more consistent speeds across segments
- **Turn handling** - Agility rats maintain speed better through track sections
- **Counter high-variance opponents** - Reduces luck factor

**Strategic Use**: Critical in high-speed races where consistency wins. Counters "Sewer Dweller" chaos.

### Speed (50-100)

- **Base speed potential** - Higher speed = higher ceiling
- **Early game impact** - Speed-heavy rats excel in first 2 segments
- **Multiplied by bloodline** - Speed Demon gets 1.15x, making speed stat more valuable

**Strategic Use**: Stack speed with Speed Demon for explosive starts. Less important for late-game bloodlines.

## Bloodlines - The Meta Game

### Speed Demon (5% rarity, 1.15x multiplier)

**Min Stats**: 85+ across the board

**Perk: Explosive Start**

- First 2 segments: +10% speed, 50% reduced variance
- Incredibly consistent early game
- Falls off in segments 3-5 due to lack of fatigue resistance

**Playstyle**: Blitz strategy - dominate early, hope opponents can't catch up

**Strong Against**:

- Alley Cat (consistent but slower)
- Sewer Dweller (too chaotic to compete early)

**Weak Against**:

- Underground Elite (catches up in late game)
- Street Runner (adaptive counter-play)

**Best Conditions**:

- Short races (when added)
- Low-stamina opponent fields
- Morning races (before fatigue matters)

---

### Underground Elite (10% rarity, 1.08x multiplier)

**Min Stats**: 75+

**Perk: Late Game Beast**

- Segments 3-5: +5% speed per segment (stacking)
- Reduced fatigue impact
- Gets STRONGER as race progresses

**Playstyle**: Endurance strategy - survive early, dominate late

**Strong Against**:

- Speed Demon (catches up after their early burst)
- City Slicker (outlasts time bonuses)

**Weak Against**:

- Sewer Dweller (chaos can upset calculated play)
- Alley Cat (fatigue resistance neutralizes advantage)

- **Best for**: City Slicker, Street Runner

### Night Racing (8 PM - 12 AM)

- Underground Elite gets +8% speed
- All variance reduced by 10%
- **Best for**: Underground Elite, Alley Cat

---

## Counter-Matchup System

### How It Works

Every bloodline has hidden modifiers against specific opponents:

**Example: Speed Demon vs Alley Cat**

- Speed Demon gets 1.05x speed modifier against Alley Cat
- This applies to EVERY segment
- With 3 Alley Cats in race, Speed Demon gets massive advantage

### Matchup Chart

| Your Bloodline    | Strong Against (1.03-1.05x)      | Weak Against (0.95-0.97x)        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Speed Demon       | Alley Cat, Sewer Dweller         | Underground Elite, Street Runner |
| Underground Elite | Speed Demon, City Slicker        | Sewer Dweller, Alley Cat         |
| Street Runner     | City Slicker, Speed Demon        | Underground Elite, Alley Cat     |
| City Slicker      | Alley Cat, Street Runner         | Speed Demon, Underground Elite   |
| Alley Cat         | Speed Demon, City Slicker        | Street Runner, Underground Elite |
| Sewer Dweller     | Underground Elite, Street Runner | Speed Demon, City Slicker        |

**Strategic Implications**:

- Scout lobby before picking rat
- Counter-pick dominant bloodlines
- If 3+ Speed Demons → bring Underground Elite
- If 3+ of any bloodline → bring their counter

## Race Composition Analysis

The system automatically analyzes race composition and provides insights:

### High-Stamina Race (avg stamina > 80)

- Late-game bloodlines favored
- Speed Demon struggles
- Pick: Underground Elite, Alley Cat

### Low-Stamina Race (avg stamina < 65)

- Early burst strategies dominate
- Late-game scaling wasted
- Pick: Speed Demon, City Slicker (if rush hour)

### High-Speed Competition (avg speed > 85)

- Consistency and agility matter more
- Variance control critical
- Pick: Alley Cat, high-agility builds

### High-Agility Field (avg agility > 85)

- Low-variance environment
- Steady performance wins
- Avoid: Sewer Dweller

---

## Advanced Strategy

### Team Composition

When entering races, analyze:

1. **Bloodline distribution** - Is one bloodline dominating? (3+ same bloodline)
2. **Average stats** - High stamina = late game, low stamina = early game
3. **Time of day** - Does your rat have time bonuses?
4. **Your rat's counters** - Do you counter multiple opponents?

### Rat Selection Priority

1. **Rush hour City Slicker** - If it's rush hour and you have one, instant pick
2. **Counter-pick dominant bloodline** - If 3+ Speed Demons, bring Underground Elite
3. **Match race duration expectations** - Stamina for long, speed for short
4. **Avoid bad matchups** - Don't bring Speed Demon into high-stamina night races

### Meta Predictions

- **Early meta**: Speed Demon dominance (everyone wants wins fast)
- **Mid meta**: Underground Elite rise (counters Speed Demon)
- **Late meta**: City Slicker timing plays (scheduled race entries)
- **Final meta**: Alley Cat consistency (tournament finals)

---

## Stat Allocation Strategy

When selecting/breeding rats:

### Speed Demon Build

- **Priority**: Speed > Agility > Stamina
- **Target**: 95+ speed, 85+ agility, 85 stamina (minimum)
- **Why**: Maximize early burst, agility for consistency

### Underground Elite Build

- **Priority**: Stamina > Speed > Agility
- **Target**: 95+ stamina, 85+ speed, 75+ agility
- **Why**: Maximum late-game scaling, survive to segments 3-5

### City Slicker Build

- **Priority**: Agility > Speed > Stamina
- **Target**: 95+ agility, 85+ speed, 65+ stamina
- **Why**: Maximize rush hour bonus with consistency

### Alley Cat Build

- **Priority**: Balanced (all stats equal)
- **Target**: 80+ across all stats
- **Why**: Consistency + fatigue resistance = reliable placer

## Rarity vs Viability

**Common Misconception**: Legendary rats always win

**Reality**:

- Speed Demon (Legendary 5%): Strong but situational
- Underground Elite (Epic 10%): Meta defining
- Street Runner (Rare 20%): Solid flex pick
- City Slicker (Common 25%): Dominates rush hours
- Alley Cat (Common 25%): Best consistent performer
- Sewer Dweller (Rare 15%): Meme tier (but fun)

**Conclusion**: Rarity ≠ Power. Matchups and timing > rarity.

---

## Example Race Analysis

**Scenario**: 6-rat race at 6:30 PM (Evening Rush)

**Opponents**:

- 2x Speed Demon (both 90+ stats)
- 1x Underground Elite (88 stamina, 82 speed)
- 1x Alley Cat (78 stats)
- 1x Sewer Dweller (chaos rat)

**Your Rats**:

- Speed Demon (92 speed, 85 stamina, 87 agility)
- City Slicker (88 speed, 91 agility, 70 stamina)
- Underground Elite (91 stamina, 84 speed, 79 agility)

**Analysis**:

- Rush hour → City Slicker gets +12% speed
- 2x Speed Demon opponents → Vulnerable to late game
- High agility matters more (rush hour bonus)
- Your City Slicker counters 2 Speed Demons

**Optimal Pick**: City Slicker

- Rush hour bonus (+12%)
- High agility (91) maximizes bonus
- Counters Speed Demon opponents
- **Estimated win probability**: 35-40%

## Future Mechanics (Planned)

- Track-specific bonuses
- Weather conditions
- Rat breeding/genetics
- Tournament ELO system
- Racing leagues with entry restrictions

**Remember**: Rat Racer rewards strategy, not luck. Study the meta, understand matchups, and time your races.

Good luck, racer!
